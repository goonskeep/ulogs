### About

The steam addon for ulogs went dark or broken somehow? [the page is an error](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=948692202), be my guest to figure that out, and the [version of ulogs on github](https://github.com/myrage2000/ulogs) associated with that steam addon seems to no longer exist. [that github user](https://github.com/myrage2000/) didn't change their name, so the link wasn't broken due to a name change.

This is all speculatory however, at the end of the day the addon is still around and still in use on our server, so we're going to maintain it.
