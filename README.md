### About

The steam addon for ulogs went dark, and the version of ulogs on github associated with that steam addon seems to no longer exist. 

Ether it was deleted or the github user changed their name, whichever, this addon is still in use on our server and still needs to be maintained.

### Installation

Place into `*/garrysmod/addons/`

### Configuration

You can edit the configuration file under `*/garrysmod/addons/ultimatelogs/lua/ultimatelogs/configuration.lua`
